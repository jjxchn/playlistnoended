            <h3>I Sit and Watch the Worm Beneath My Nail - TRAITRS</h3>
            <p>Pictures fade for you tonight with the winter behind the moon<br>I sit and watch the world go by with the worm beneath my nail<br>All those little things that make me itch are tied up in your hair<br>Life is all just tick tick tick as it all goes by<br>Devil comes for you tonight, take the bear but not the field<br>Every little thing will watch him die, all caught up in the meal<br>And we'll for days may come and go but I don't belong<br>I'm all alone with this last kiss as it's all gone by<br>It's all gone by<br>It's all gone by<br>It's all gone by<br>It's all gone by<br>I stole from Bibles, changed thеir words, made a hundred children cry<br>Bеneath the ground and watch me twitch, took me twenty years to die<br>And I don't want to hurt like this, where we starve and then we die<br>Heavy on my rage and drunken as it's all gone by<br>It's all gone by<br>It's all gone by<br>It's all gone by<br>It's all gone by<br></p>
